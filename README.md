# Full-multilevel-blockNNGP

R code needed to run the simulation study and application of full multilevel block-Nearest Neighbor Gaussian process (block-NNGP) using INLA as proposed in "Fast Generalized Spatial Multilevel block-NNGP Modeling" by Zaida Quiroz, Marcos Prates, Zhiyong Hu and Dipak Dey (https://arxiv.org/pdf/NUMBER.pdf).
