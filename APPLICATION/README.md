# Fast Generalized Spatial Multilevel block-NNGP Modeling

## Zaida Quiroz, Marcos Prates, Zhiyong Hu and Dipak Dey.

We provide the R code needed to run  full multilevel block-NNGP models using Integrated Nested Laplace approximation (INLA) applied to study the sales price of houses in Beijing. 

You have to add "INLA"  from https://www.r-inla.org/download-install. 


- [main] Beijing_gamma.R: call data and fit generalized gamma full multilevel block-NNGP models. 
- [main] Beijing_lognormal.R: call data and fit generalized lognormal full multilevel block-NNGP models. 
- find neighbor.R:  auxiliary functions.
- NEWbeijing.RData: Beijing housing transactions data.
