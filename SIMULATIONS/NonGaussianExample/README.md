We provide the R code needed to run simulations of full-multilevel block-NNGP model, for response data following a gamma distribution, using Integrated Nested Laplace approximation (INLA). The user can simulate data from gaussian or other distributions available in INLA, please see https://www.r-inla.org/documentation#h.ldt45kpbu659 for some examples. And use the following command in R: inla.list.models()
